### What Iâ€™m focused on (2025)
- **AI-native cybersecurity**: protecting agentic workflows, data flows, and endpoints without adding SOC noise.
- **Resilience posture**: measurable RTO/RPO, cross-stack dependency graphs, and evidence-based DR.
- **Next-gen DLP**: context-aware detection (beyond regex), local/lightweight models, human-in-the-loop.
- **Systems at scale**: eBPF sensing, WASM sandboxes, Kubernetes, WebRTC streaming.

### Previously worked on
- **Socket.IO**: worked on socket.io and socket.io-redis-adapter to make sure we can work with socket.io at scale utilizing redis pub/sub mechanism
- **eBPF**: worked on several ebpf projects.. was quite fun
- **NATS Steaming Server**: contributed in my other account, deployed it in several production systems
- **Bitbucket-mcp**: started it for my needs. The first bitbucket MCP that can work in an enterprise without the risk of breaking things.. still the most used bitbucket mcp globally (quite weird)
- Many more... (I also use a second GitHub account for legacy OSS, org-managed work, etc)

### Always open to
- Collaborating on open-source eBPF/WASM security tooling  
- Advising AI-security founders on product/market fit and dashboards  
- Speaking about agent safety, resilience posture, and CISO-ready UX
